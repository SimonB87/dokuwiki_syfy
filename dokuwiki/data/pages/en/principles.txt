====== Basic principles ======

ScreenFactory is a software development tool that

  * Unordered List Itemshould increase the efficiency of design, development and deployment of client applications
  * does not require deep technical knowledge of software development and as such it allows the developer to focus more on the business side of the problem domain
  * is specialized for creation of client side layer of information systems, that is applications that serve mainly for work with forms and structured data records
  * creates HTML5 SPAs (Single Page Applications)
  * can be used for development of applications with responsive design and/or applications targeted for mobile borwsers; while this approach is possible, it often requires some extra work on stylesheets and page layout design.

From the developer point of view

  * it contains visual editor for forms (WYSIWYG)
  * some behaviour is defined through expressions (similar to formulas in Microsoft Excel)
  * some behaviour is defined through scripting in ActionLang, that is the same language used in other Solitea tools like Metasystem
  * is extensible through adding new visual components and new API for scripting

===== What is HTML5 + javascript =====

HTML5 and javascript is modern software development approach for development of software client applications (usually web clients). In comparison to traditional web applications where the UI (user interface) was rendered on the server and each change of UI required loading of whole page again, HTML5 applications often use javascript to modify the page within the browser and without the need for reloading the page. This is especially true for SPA applications where the UI is usually not rendered on the server at all and where templating approach is usually used on the client side (that is in the user browser).

While HTML5 applications are not limited to web and there are many software applications that use combination of native client container rendering the HTML5 application, most of the use is still aimed for the web clients.

HTML is the markup language that is describing the UI while javascript is the programming language which manipulates this HTML to put it to live. As javascript is not best suited to development of large applications, other languages are often used instead and later transpiled to javascript (ie. Typescript, Coffeescript).
