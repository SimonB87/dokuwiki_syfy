====== Using IDE ======

===== Windows docking =====

IDE allows user to customize the layout of individual windows. It is possible to move them and dock in different positions (at the edges of the IDE or in other windows), create groups of windows with tabs and either pin them or let them slide to the side of window leaving only tab header visible. This is very similar to other IDE like Enterprise Architect or Visual Studio. Work with individual artefacts is usually done in the central part of the screen and it is possible to switch between artefacts with the help of tab headers or by pressing CTRL+Tab. It is possible to reset the layout to default (menu Tools -> Layout reset). Layout is saved together with the project but in different file. This is especially useful if you want to control which file should go into source code respository and which should be ignored and different for every user.

On the left side it is possible to change the scale of whole application by the plus and minus slider.

===== Menu =====

Menu contains the standard commands like opening and saving of the project.

Buttons {{image4.png?10x11}} and {{image5.png?10x11}} allows you to undo last step (CTRL+Z) or if you already did, to redo it again (Ctrl+Y). Clicking on green arrow will do the same as menu item Build & Run.


It is possible to report bug or send us suggestion in Help section of the menu.

===== Preferences =====

Preferences dialog can be opened from the menu (Edit -> Preferences). It allows to set many things that are not directly connected with current projects. Some of the important ones are

  * Save project before build - allows you to automatically save the project before you build it
  * Stop build on errors - this controls whether generated application should be opened even if there were errors in the build
  * Open result in browser - allows to choose which browser should be used to open application. The dialog offers all the browsers it can find installed in the system. Item Internet explorer (managed) allows to run the application in the same Internet Explorer tab without always opening new tab after every build. Other browsers don`t have this option.
  * Editor options - this allows you to control whether visual WYSIWYG designer is used or not and which editor of forms is prefered (opened first).

Besides these preferences, there is another dialog with Project options that contains settings tied with current project.
