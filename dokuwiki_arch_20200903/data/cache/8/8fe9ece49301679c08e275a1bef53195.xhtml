<div class="level1">

<p>
Project is composed of packages. Every project contains at least one package. The purpose of packages is to enable sharing parts of the project between multiple projects. Packages may use other packages without limitation (including circular references). Packages are as well a way to add new components to the project (see custom components, custom api objects). Project contains only packages, project options and possibly user options. Project must contain at least one package with at least one form.
</p>

<p>
Project and its packages are saved in XML files. Either individually (project separate, packages separate, every artefact separate) or zipped (one file containing the same structure but in ZIP format). It is possible to use zipped package in not-zipped project. Project file has the extension <em>sfproj</em>, zipped one <em>sfprojx</em>. Package are usually saved into its own folders and has extension <em>package</em> or <em>packagex</em>.
</p>

<p>
Files may be shared or put into versioning system. In case of versioning system we recommend not to use zipped format.
</p>

<p>
Note: ScreenFactory does not have built-in support for any versioning system.
</p>

<p>
Next the the project, there is as well file with extension <em>sfprojlayout</em> that contains informations about layout of windows in IDE and opened tabs and file with extension <em>sfuser</em> that contains user settings. We recommend not to share these files between multiple developers or put them into versioning system. In case of GIT you may want to consider adding these two estensions to .gitignore.

<div class="level2">

<p>
For testing and deployment of the project it is needed to run build (menu <em>Project - Build and run</em> or <em>Project</em> <em>– Build</em>). In <em>User options</em> it is possible to specify output folder where the built application is copied and it is as well possible to change the address that is used in the browser to open the application.

Part of SF IDE is as well sfcmd.exe utility for running some operations from command line. It allows to run build and tests. For more information run the utility without parameters or with parameter /?.

<h3 class="sectionedit4" id="postbuildcommand">PostBuildCommand</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
In more complicated scenarios (ie. deploying to multiple locations in cluster, additional manipulation with deployed files etc.) it is possible to add to project resource cmd batch (extension cmd) and set its Action to <em>PostBuildCommand</em>. Such script will run after each build with following parameters:
</p>

<p>
<em>{command} {Target folder} {Project name} {ProjectFile} {Build_output_file}</em>
</p>

<p>
In the same time, some system variables will be set (SF_xxx) which are more readable for further use. To get complete list of variables you can create new project, add default postBuildCommand and see the result in Output/Build window

It is possible to add artefacts (<em>Form</em>, <em>Data entity</em>, …) into them and structure the artefacts into folders.

In package properties it is possible to change alias, that is name that will be used for it in current project.

Packages have their own version. Each project consists of version number and when loading it shows warning if package on the disk version does not match the one the project was saved with.
